Brain Tumor MRI Classification 🧠🩻

This project focuses on classifying brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning techniques. The goal is to provide an automated and reliable way to assist medical professionals in early detection and diagnosis.

📌 Project Overview

Brain tumors can be life-threatening if not detected early. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify MRI scans into tumor and non-tumor categories, aiming to support clinical decision-making with AI-powered tools.

⚙️ Features

Preprocessing of MRI images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

Deep learning model for tumor classification (CNN-based).

Training, validation, and evaluation with performance metrics.

Visualization of training history and sample predictions.

📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled brain MRI scans (Tumor / No Tumor).
